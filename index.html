Part 3 of a series from Olivia’s birthday, where we traveled to her 40th country before her 30th year.)\nAfter we dropped our rental car at the Zurich airport, it was easy to catch transit to Vaduz: the train station is in the same building as the air terminals. Getting to Vaduz isn’t as easy as you might think, however: we had to take a train to Zürich HB and switch to a train to Sargans, Switzerland before catching a bus to Vaduz, Liechtenstein. A cursory glance at the schedule didn’t make it seem as easy as it actually turned out to be!\nThis doesn’t look easy… but it actually is.\nVaduz is the seat of the Principality of Liechtenstein. The country itself is a small, constitutional hereditary monarchy: there’s a Prince, Prince Hans-Adam II, the 13th thus far, and a “diet”, which consists of elected members. Both bodies can create laws, but the Prince ultimately has final say. It was fascinating learning first-hand about this intimate, friendly city!\nWalking Vaduz\nIt was raining when we left Zurich, and when we arrived in Vaduz by bus, the weather was still a bit nasty, but letting up. We weren’t sure where to go, at first: Vaduz is a touristy town, but there’s not a lot of help if you’re not staying at a nearby hotel. Luckily, the Visitor’s Center was nearby, so we were able to get out of the cold mist and get our bearings.\nRidiculous hood, but big smiles, to start the day!\nWe opted to stamp our passports, (it costs 6€) and were directed to a bus station to lock up our bags. In that short time, the mist had lessened and the clouds thinned, so started getting much more comfortable. We had a quick lunch at Brasserie Burg, (there weren’t many options on Saturday, as the weekend tends to be quite slow) and put together a plan for our few hours in town.\nPutting together a plan!\nCastle Vaduz\nThe photos are accurate: the city is a strange cross between a modern city and something out of a fairy tale. The 13th century castle, and private residence of the monarchy, overlooks the tightly-packed lanes dotted with construction cranes. While there aren’t any tours of the residence, there are several pathways that lead up to the castle, and a stunning view.\nOlivia would get her hike on this trip after all.\nCastle Vaduz, as seen from the Red House and winery.\nThe hike is pretty steep to start, but bearable. It can be a bit confusing, as houses and their adjacent property butt directly to the trail. Thankfully there are many signs that serve to both let you know you’re on the right path and tell you about the country.\nOne of eight signs explaining the history and current government of Liechtenstein.\nOnce you reach the castle, you’re granted a pretty impressive view of the entire city… it’s likely unparalleled anywhere else. The castle, while seemingly accessible, is pretty foreboding — it’s a private residence, after all. So after a few photos of the view, we headed back down to wander a bit.\nThe view from Castle Vaduz. Note the winery at the famous Red House.\nThe Red House\nThe Red House is probably the oldest building in Vaduz, its origins stretching back to the 14th century. It’s in private ownership at the moment by Egon Rheinberger, a famous painter, but still serves as a tourist landmark.\nThe Red House and vineyard.\nAfter an hour or so of walking the quiet streets with a few other tourist couples nearby, we headed back to the bus station to catch the bus and 8-hour train to Vienna. Before heading out, though, we stopped for a few “supplies” for the train ride, including a bottle of the Prince’s wine!\nThe Prince’s Pinot Noir…!\nTrain to Vienna\nThe train system in Europe is notoriously fast, extensive and relatively cheap: our train to Vienna was no exception. Topping out at 160 km\u002Fhr at times, we rocketed across Austria and took some time to relax with small, handmade sandwiches and wine.\nAll of this was 6€, or about $7 USD.\nWe avoided travel weariness with banter and funny photos…\n\n…but not all of us could stay awake for the entire ride… ❤️\nOur battle of sleeping photos continues… Clint+1.\nIn the end, though, Liv stepped off the train into her 40th country, before her 30th birthday… Mission Accomplished! An awesome pair of days in the gorgeous city of Vienna lay ahead."},{"categories":["travel","rigi","interlaken","switzerland"],"link":"https:\u002F\u002Fclintandrewhall.medium.com\u002Finterlaken-rigi-switzerland-d47e5a11c2a","timestamp":1611639676000,"title":"Interlaken & Rigi, Switzerland","summary":"40 by 30: Interlaken & Rigi, Switzerland\nNovember 23rd - 25th, 2017\n(Originally posted to Facebook in 2017. Part 2 of a series from Olivia’s birthday, where we traveled to her 40th country before her 30th year.)\nWe arrived in Zurich rather late in the evening, so we opted for a jet-lagged sleep at a local airport hotel, ibis budget Zurich Airport. After a nice sleep and quick (free) breakfast, we went back to the airport to pick up our rental car for our drive to Interlaken.\nIn past trips to Europe, we’ve opted for the cheaper manual transmission vehicles. An automatic transmission costs a bit more, but considering Avis considers a BMW x3 in Switzerland to be the same class as a Ford Focus in the US… we didn’t mind the additional charge. We spent an awkward 15 minutes trying to switch the language from German to English before finding an Avis rep to translate. And then we were off!\nThe Swiss countryside en route to Interlaken.\nWalking Interlaken\nOnce we arrived in Interlaken, the jet-lag was hitting me pretty hard. We’ve found the best way to combat it is to eat the correct meals for the time of day in your adoptive time zone… which meant lunch. After a drive around the narrow lanes to find parking, a quick consult of Foursquare led us to Schuh Interlaken, a comfy spot with an attached sweet shop.\nWe were really excited about our hotel, the Lindner Hotels & Resorts (Grand Hotel Beau Rivage). November is an off-season month, so prices were really reasonable. They weren’t quite ready for us after lunch, so we decided to walk the Aare river and take in the scenery.\nOur room would end up being the middle of the fourth floor.\nInterlaken sits precisely between two lakes: Lake Brienz to the east and Lake Thun to the west. The Beau Rivage is directly on the Aare river between the two on the east side, which makes for a lovely walk west into the city. At that time of day, the sun was beginning its descent behind the tall mountains, so the glow on the trees, buildings and water was really gorgeous.\nA grassy field on the water’s edge to the south.\nLiv and I really enjoyed these couple of hours. The walk along the water was incredibly peaceful, with few tourists. I got really shutter-happy with my camera — the light was just incredible. There were also a number of different kinds of ducks, gulls, and a couple of swans making the rounds throughout.\nAn early portion of the walk, near our hotel.\nInterlaken is a pretty popular town to visit, as it turns out. I had a number of friends comment and message me about their experiences there, which was really awesome! It seems to be surrounded on most side by mountains… we saw at least half a dozen paragliders circling overhead, coming to a landing in a large park near the city center.\nA paraglider heading toward downtown.\nWhile we intended to make it as far as the lake, we walked pretty much as far as we could. After we passed the bulk of downtown, the pathway became blocked by some construction projects. The sun was nearly set when we reluctantly turned around and headed back on the opposite side of the river.\nJust after sunset on the west of the city.\nOne of the most noticeable (and I as I was to find out, infamous) features of Interlaken is the “Hardermannli”, the bald, diamond-shaped rock face. There are actually two legends of this rock face:\nThe first legend has it that back when monastic life in Interlaken was at its peak, there was a monk who chanced upon a girl from Unterseen who was gathering wood while he was walking up on the Harder. He chased the unsuspecting child so long that in her terror she fell over the abyss to her death. Heavenly judgment instantly turned the monk to stone and he was condemned to look at his place of crime for eternity.\nThe second version of the legend tells of the unforgiving abbot of the monastery, whom everyone called Harder. The story goes that he was infatuated in a fisherman’s daughter and hounded her until she eventually became pregnant. She swallowed poison but not before letting her father know what had happened. In his rage, the father split the abbot’s skull with an ax. This act was followed by thunder and lightning over Interlaken, and afterwards the locals were able to recognise Harder’s face high up in the rock wall.\nTry as I might, I wasn’t able to see anyone’s face in the rough rock. I took “his” picture anyway, in case I’d spot him later.\nThe Harder — can you spot him?\nLike other towns we’ve visited with water running through them, (e.g. San Antonio, Venice, etc), Interlaken has a number of gates to control the flow to prevent flooding. I was also surprised to learn there are actually two waterways: the Aare river and a shipping canal that stays the same level as Lake Thun, connecting to a quay and railway. That explained a confusing fork in the water as we made our way back!\nOne of the control gates close to our hotel, after sunset, as we walked along the north side of the Aare.\nWe took advantage of the time difference and relative peace to video call Kathryn and Pierre in Niagara-on-the-Lake. We had no problem showing off the view…! 😀\nWe checked into the hotel and made our way downstairs for dinner. We had their dining room all to ourselves, which made for a romantic, fireplace-centered meal, followed by simple cocktails in their lounge.\nThe Harder-kulm and Bahn\nDirectly behind the hotel and across the river is a funicular that takes you to the top of the Harder. Our “Interlaken Visitors Passes” furnished by the Beau Rivage gave us a sizable discount for the 8-minute ride, so it seemed like it would be difficult to pass up. Olivia loves to sneak hiking into our trips when I least expect it, so it was a relief to hear we didn’t have time for the two-hour trek to the top…!\nThe yin and yang of our relationship, in a poster for the Harder funicular.\nOn the way up we did, indeed, see many people hiking the trail below us. On such a gorgeous day, it would have made for great exercise! There is also a nice restaurant at the top in a pavilion with a glass (!) observation deck extending out from the (nauseatingly steep) cliff.\nThe view from Harder-kulm. Note the split in the waterway in the lower right.\nWe took a moment to enjoy the bright sunshine, (and let a rare-but-noisy tour group finish their selfies) at the cafe. People watching was at its best: we heard a woman behind us ask the server if she was in Germany, and he informed her, in broken-but-admirable English, that, no, she was in Switzerland. Her follow-up question, “oh… well, which way is Germany?” was our cue to vacate our table as he tried to both understand her question and answer.\nIt was another shutter-happy day for me, but we were on a time crunch: we had every intention of making it up the Jungfraujoch, (the so-called “Top of Europe”, the highest point in the area) before heading to our spa day in Rigi. Unfortunately, the day would get away from us, so we made it to Grindelwald for lunch before heading to Weggis to catch the funicular to Rigi. This would be the meal where I had my first (of three) Weiner Schnitzels!\nDelicious.\nRigi Kaltbad\nOur destination, the Hotel Rigi Kaltbad, was located in a car-free area at the top of a mountain. To get there, one must park and take a funicular, so we were in kind of a rush to arrive — nothing would suck more than not being able to get to the top! Thankfully, it runs every half-hour, so we were able to catch a ride up.\nThe view on the way up… quite high, as it turns out.\nOur hotel is also a popular spa… as such, I don’t have many photos, (as they prohibit cameras in most places, for privacy). We spent several hours wading around, both indoors and outdoors, in the warm water flowing through various features. It was really, really relaxing.\nAfter a soak in the “quiet” room, (and avoiding the couple obviously doing something to each other beneath the bubbles), we made ourselves ready for another promising meal.\nSunset from our room in Rigi.\nThe food and wine were spectacular, but what we didn’t expect was the company: everyone we’d seen an hour earlier in their bathing suits (or nude in the steam room) were now at tables around each other. It made for interesting table conversation!\nWe had a few after-dinner cocktails and played a few games of pool beside a crackling fire, ending our day in probably the best way possible, (yet again). The next morning, we’d be driving back to Zurich for our train to Vaduz, Liechtenstein!\nA nice way to end the evening…!"},{"categories":["portugal","travel","lisbon","layover"],"link":"https:\u002F\u002Fclintandrewhall.medium.com\u002Flisbon-portugal-a1e483dd66a3","timestamp":1611639123000,"title":"Lisbon, Portugal","summary":"40 by 30: Lisbon, Portugal\nNovember 22nd, 2017\n(Originally posted to Facebook in 2017. Part 1 of a series from Olivia’s birthday, where we traveled to her 40th country before her 30th year.)\nOlivia and I took a six-hour, 6:15 pm flight out of JFK and arrived in Lisbon at 6am. It took a while for us to get through customs, since Portugal only honors electronic passports from EU and neighboring countries, but the line went pretty quickly.\nPortugal’s flag flying above the city, from one of the towers of Castelo de São Jorge.\nSince we had only twelve hours in our layover, we hadn’t really planned much in advance — we were just going to follow our guidebook (and the weather) wherever it would take us. We checked our bags with a storage service at the airport and stepped outside looking for transit into the city. Thankfully, the weather was more than cooperative, and we were soon on our way.\nThe Streets of Lisbon\nThe famous yellow cable cars were the most fun form of transit around the city. We didn’t need much time to find a seat — anyone not holding on when the car jolted forward was quickly put into a seat, (or their neighbor’s lap).\nThe famous yellow cable cars.\nThere was more graffiti than I was expecting… some of it beautiful, some trying to make a statement, but sometimes just a random thought someone had at some point. Later, we would encounter a tag protesting “mass tourism” in Lisbon.\nSome random graffiti seemed to welcome us to the winding streets of Lisbon.\nSome of the most beautiful graffiti was on our walk to Sao Jorge Castle. Pátio de Dom Fradique is a ruin on a less-traveled path to the castle, decorated with layers upon layers of tags. There were also random people roasting chestnuts, or “making art”, nearby.\nGraffiti on the walls of Pátio de Dom Fradique.\nWalking the lanes of Lisbon reminded me a lot of Rome: cobblestoned, with famous buildings seeming to burst out of nowhere. The roads also meander a bit, oftentimes leading you into what felt to be a private plaza, only to offer a nearby door out onto another road.\nPatio de Dom Fradique, a ruin hiding a fun route to the castle.\nThere’s a carefree air to the roads. There are few cars, lots of parents with children on their shoulders, and residents hang their laundry to dry outside their windows. Indeed, clotheslines of undergarments or kids’ clothing appeared twice as often as flower boxes.\nResidents of Lisbon seem pretty relaxed, and resourceful.\nSo matter-of-fact seem their sensibilities that an actual urine screen, complete with ancient drain, appeared shortly before the castle. The Manneken Pis silhouette reassured you, if you had any doubt, that yes: this was a place to piss.\nNo, I didn’t use it… sadly, I had gone at the airport before we set out. So I resigned to taking a picture before rounding the corner to the castle.\nYou can piss here. Legally.\nCastelo de São Jorge\nCastelo de São Jorge is an immense fortress overlooking the city. As we were visiting during the “off season” it wasn’t too busy, but there were still tour groups being led through. It would be inside, on its ramparts, that we would truly see Lisbon.\nThe towers to the right of the main entrance. The castle itself is sprawling and enormous.\nAfter a quick stop at the ticket office, we were able to enter the castle and see the city from an unparalleled vantage point. I took so many pictures from up here that it was difficult to decide which to choose for the album!\nA safely-secured cannon aims into the heart of Lisbon.\nLisbon spreads out at your feet from the narrow walkways atop the castle walls. It’s not hard to imagine soldiers defending confidently from here, even if running along the rail-less stairs would terrify me!\nLisbon from above, with tightly-packed buildings and twisting roads.\nInside the castle, the courtyard was much quieter. Rusting rails give you a bit of confidence in climbing the ancient stairs at various points, but people are comfortable waiting for them to clear nonetheless.\nThe main courtyard of the castle. Note the height of the spruce.\nMore delightful than the view, though, were the peacocks! Dozens and dozens of peacocks of various ages make Castelo de São Jorge their nesting ground. The more beautiful adults walk along the tops of the walls, while molting adolescents roosted on railings closer to the ground.\nA peacock preens on the wall outside the castle.\nMiradouro de Santa Luzia\nAfterward, we made our way over to one of the best miradouros: Miradouro de Santa Luzia. It’s famous not only for its view but for the tiled panels by António Quaresma, depicting Lisbon before the earthquake of 1755. The bust honors Julio de Castilho, a journalist and politician from the late 19th century.\nCastilho looks out over the domes, churches and Tagus river.\nLunch in Alfalma\nRounding a corner and descending a staircase, we happened upon this bit of protest, crudely scrawled in red crayon, (and in English). It would serve as a bit of foreshadowing an hour later, over lunch, in the square below.\nA protest\u002Fdemand on the wall of a staircase.\nWe decided to sit in the sun in the square outside the Museu Do Fado, at a restaurant called Taberna Ti Camila. Wine, cheese and a lit dish of oil roasting a pair of chorizo sated our ravenous (and jet-lagged) appetites… but the best was still to come.\nQueijo de Azeitao (cheese), chorizo and Victor Horta Syrah+Touriga\nBehold: a Francesinha. Popular with locals as a kind of after-hours-drunken-pleasure sandwich, this beast of a dish was amazing. I was so impressed I wrote a post about it.\nA Francesinha, sliced to show its magnificence.\nAs we chatted with our host, the purpose of the graffiti up the stairway to Miradouro de Santa Luzia became clear: seven tour groups of at least twenty people each entered the square. The groups were all arranged by the same company (we reasoned a cruise ship). After a few noisy minutes nearby, they all climbed the narrow pathway… at the same time. I imagined a local, fed up with the noise, had left the impossible-to-miss message. I wondered aloud if it would have any effect.\nPraça do Comércio\nWe wandered down a block to the Tagus river and walked its edge to the Praça do Comércio (Square of Commerce), the subject of Quaresma’s panels. The square was immense, visible from the castle, and housed interesting exhibits and tourism offices.\nPraça do Comércio, with its statue of King Jose I crushing snakes with his horse’s hooves.\nOur interest piqued with Vini Portugal, a Board of Tourism-backed wine tasting room. Dispensing machines presented a number of bottles, each costing between 1 and 3€ per two-ounce taste. The staff was incredibly nice and knowledgable, and we took plenty of phone photos of bottles we wanted to try at home.\nThe dispensing machine for the bottles featured at Vini Portugal.\nLeaving Lisbon\nAs our flight to Switzerland neared, we knew we couldn’t leave Lisbon without doing two things: buying a shot glass from the Hard Rock Cafe, and finding a glass of port. After a quick pitstop at the HRC, we decided to sample Portugal’s namesake fortified wine at Hotel Avenida Palace, Lisbon’s oldest hotel.\nThe oldest hotel in Lisbon is as opulent as it is old.\nIt was an excellent decision: a generous pour of 30 year old port was only 21€, 20 year at 13€. The bar was empty, which allowed us to drink deeply and talk loudly about the day… and how quickly we’d like to return to explore more of Portugal.\n30 year old port in Lisbon\nAfter settling up with the quiet barman, we jumped on the nearby metro, recovered our bags and flew out… and just like that, twelve hours in Lisbon (and Olivia’s 37th country), were quickly behind us.\nLiv and I in Lisbon."},{"categories":["madagascar","travel","work"],"link":"https:\u002F\u002Fclintandrewhall.medium.com\u002Fvisiting-madagascar-tradespeople-2b4cfe972567","timestamp":1549709921000,"title":"Visiting Madagascar: Tradespeople","summary":"This post is one of a series detailing our guided visit to Madagascar in 2019.\n\nMany people — usually near cities, but not always — decide not to farm and instead take up a trade. In our travels we not only saw the end result in many stores, but were taken into workshops to see how the objects were crafted.\nThe closer you are to a tourist hub, or if the craft involves objects to be bought by tourists instead of exported, there is some theatre involved. The staged workshops are taken up mostly by benches for an audience, even. It became clear later that a majority of these products are made elsewhere. Despite this, you’ll find the demonstrations fascinating.\nAway from the tourist hubs, the demonstrations become more real — honest depictions of a skilled or difficult trade.\nDuring our week in Madagascar we saw five:\n\nModel vehicles from recycled materials;\nObjects made from Zébu horns;\nWooden veneer cut and stitched together to make art;\nWooden ornaments carved from local hardwoods;\nAluminum pots and lids cast from discarded window frames.\n\nRecycled Models\nThe first shop we visited was in Antsirabe: a model shop.\nLeft: bicycles, taxis, rickshaws, and even planes wait to be taken home. Right: a workbench where a craftsman demonstrated creating a bike wheel.\nThe models were all created from upcycled materials:\n\nThe bodies and panels were snipped from aluminum cans, allowing each model to take on a unique color palette.\nThe wheels were discarded air hoses from refrigerators, sealed together with a bit of scrap tubing melted inside.\nThe wheel wells were aluminum, formed around a butane spray can and connected with a touch of solder melted by candle.\nThe spokes of the bicycle wheels were worn-out fishing lines, stitched through the aluminum, holding a spring from a mousetrap in the center.\n\nWe watched as a well-dressed man effortlessly made a bicycle wheel using only an awl against wood and scrap templates. It was as if he’d done it hundreds of times, and, looking around the shop, it was clear he had… but only the wheel. There were no other forms, tools, scraps or other items on his workbench… only wheels and finished products… at just-high-enough-to-be-unreasonable-to-me prices.\nWhile the storefront was presented to us as a small workshop of unique souvenirs, later we would see these same models in dozens of stores throughout Madagascar, most sealed in plastic cling wrap. Then, when we visited the small village toward the end of our trip, we saw one of the men with the missing tools and scraps, making models from scratch in the shade of his home.\nIn a remote village days later, ducks guard crates of flattened aluminum cans as a man on the left (not pictured) builds model bikes.\nZébu Horn Smithing\nThe Malagasy have a native cow called a Zébu. Like cows found in the US, Canada and Europe, they produce milk and are slaughtered for meat. In recent years, Zébu have been bred with Norwegian cattle. This extends a Zébu’s milk production from a few liters a day to dozens. You can identify a native Zébu by the hump behind its neck: the taller the hump, the more “pure” the Zébu. Zébu horns have an interesting shape, at a more acute angle, and the Malagasy have found many interesting ways to ensure they don’t go to waste.\nA pair of native Zébu, with tall humps and large horns, struggling to climb a rough road to Lac Tritriva.\nBehind a storefront next to the Model Shop, we were led into large work shed with benches. A young woman began a polished presentation on how Zébu horns, reclaimed before they dry out and at the right age, can be made into all kinds of things: cutlery, dominos, jewelry. Once the inner marrow is removed, each portion of the outer horn can be repurposed based on its density; cutlery from the hollow base, dominos from the solid tip.\nLeft: a pan of beeswax, a sheet of steel where handmade saw-blades are cut, and discarded jeans from which polishing wheels are cut. Right: a pile of Zébu horns and the motor of an old washing machine allow a craftsman to sand the edges of a spoon.\nA craftsman came in to demonstrate as she described the (intensive) process of making a spoon:\n\nFirst, the horn is boiled. This loosens the inner marrow from the horn so it can be pounded loose and removed, leaving the hollow horn shell.\nA saw blade, each tooth notched by hand into a circle cut from a discarded sheet of steel, is attached to the motor of an old washing machine. This cuts the rough spoon template from the horn.\nThe template is then dipped in hot beeswax and burned over charcoal. This kills any parasites that might be living the horn and prepares it for shaping and polishing. The smell is like that of burnt hair.\nA piece of sandpaper is then attached to the motor, and the edges of the template are sanded down.\nFinally, five layers of denim, cut from a pair of old jeans, are stacked and attached to the motor. This polishes the horn surface into a smooth, shiny finished product. Each set of five circles can polish a dozen spoons.\n\nThey let me keep the demonstration spoon, and then led us into the store at the front, where a large variety of Zébu horn objects were for sale. As with the Model Shop, the theatrics were finished and it was time to buy something.\nThe young woman from the demonstration appeared a few moments later with a child in her arms. On one hand, it was a bit manipulative: she didn’t speak to us, but made sure she, and especially the infant, were always within our line-of-sight. On the other, this was how they made their living. They had a script they knew worked, and they followed it. But something was itching my mind, just like the Model Shop: not a lot of workspace, few hands, few raw materials. I felt like this was just the show floor, and the show was what we were paying for.\nStill, the work was impressive, and the interesting thing about Zébu horns is that they come in a number of colors — just like the Zébu themselves. Liv found a nice pair of salad tongs in white-streaked tan for the equivalent of a few dollars. The store owner thanked us, wrapped them in paper, and cautioned us to put them in our suitcase. Perhaps leaving the country with animal horn cutlery, however processed, is frowned upon? We saw no notice at the airport when we left, and didn’t ask otherwise.\nVeneer Stitching\nA few days later, we visited Ambositra, a city known for its artisans. One that struck me the most was an older man, perhaps in his late 50’s, sitting at a handmade scroll saw. He was cutting pieces of veneer to be stitched together to create artwork.\nLeft: a man at his homemade scroll saw, sorts through a stack of paper templates, with finished works on display. Right: a keychain pendant made from two different pieces of veneer combined.\nThe saw itself was impressive, (and you can refer to the photo above as it is described). The saw blade is a reclaimed emergency brake line wire. This wire is laid into a channel in the top of a wooden block (to his right). He then uses a chisel to notch the wire into sharp teeth, one notch every few millimeters. The new saw blade is then stretched between two tines of a long steel fork, taken from the rear suspension of a car. There is a large spring, also from the car, underneath the work surface, which applies upward pressure to the fork. To operate the saw, the carpenter simply pulls down on the lower tine of the fork, using a handle attached to it. The spring then pushes the fork upward, creating a smooth sawing motion.\nThe wood he uses comes from a number of sources. The thin strips are soaked in water for a darker color, or left alone for a lighter color. It has a density and consistency similar to balsa. Each color seen in the finished product is from a different piece of wood, assembled together like puzzle pieces. After a dry fitting, each piece is given a small swipe of glue along its edge and put into place. The carpenter then glides his chisel along the surface, leveling the different thicknesses of wood into a smooth, final surface.\nHe demonstrated his technique with a small heart-shaped pendant, then gave it to me as a gift. We gave him a bit of cash for his time, and went to the workshop next door.\nWood Carving\nIn a workshop across the square, several men sat working with tools on hunks of wood.\nA man uses a set of carving tools and a wooden hammer to create a bookend shaped like a chameleon on a branch.\nTsu explained that there were several kinds of wood native to Madagascar that could be used to make things, the most well-known being Malagasy Rosewood.\nRosewood is unique to Madagascar, and heavily sought after in China and beyond. The demand for the deep reddish-purple wood is so intense it forced the government to declare it a protected resource. With deforestation from that high demand, as well as slash-and-burn farming, there is now a tension between local people trying to use their resources and the country trying to to protect them.\nAluminum Smithing\nA day later we were en route to Antananarivo, and we would stop halfway to experience by far the most intense demonstration: aluminum smithing.\nWe were led behind a large home to find a dozen men working in several open-air buildings surrounding a square. In the square were several men using large brick smelts to melt down discarded aluminum.\nLeft: a man in the background cuts aluminum window frames into four-inch pieces while another, in sandals, heats them to 800 degrees to remove debris. Right: steel pot forms rest beside purified aluminum ingots.\nThe heat coming from this area was unbelievable. The brick kilns are used to heat the pieces of discarded aluminum to 800 degrees. A smith then stirs the melted metal, where bits of dirt or debris float to the top — he discards them, flipping them aside using the end of his staff. The melted aluminum is then drained into a small reservoir at the bottom, where is cools into an ingot.\nIn front of the other building around the square are larger brick furnaces where the ingots are combined and melted. From these furnaces, other smiths take measured pours of liquid metal to make various formed objects. We were to watch a team of two men make an aluminum pot.\nMaking an aluminum pot: form, pour, drain, dump. These men produce a pot and lid every five minutes.\nThe process is dirty, dangerous and must be done quickly:\n\nThe men use and reuse powdered charcoal in their molds. It is easily molded and can handle large amounts of heat all while not sticking to the aluminum.\nWooden squares are stacked around a steel form using steel rods to keep them aligned. In the foreground, a man is making the pot. In the background, the corresponding lid.\nWith each square added, powdered charcoal is added and pounded around the form with feet and hands. A plastic load and drain pipe is kept clear through each layer.\nOnce the charcoal is packed around the mold, each square is carefully lifted and the form is removed, leaving an empty space, (not pictured).\nOne man uses the steel form to keep pressure against the mold while another pours a ceramic container of red-hot liquid aluminum, fresh from the furnace, into the load pipe.\nAfter a few seconds, he pokes a steel rod into the side of bottom of the form, allowing air and gravity to push the liquid aluminum throughout the mold and any excess to drain.\nThe aluminum cools quickly. The men dump the charcoal into the communal pile, leaving the freshly-poured pot contaminant free, (you can see the heat rising from the dumped powder in the photo).\nOnce completely cool, rough edges are cut or sanded away, leaving the finished pot, (not pictured).\n\nLiv and I were dumbstruck. These men work in extreme heat with boiling liquid metal with no gloves or boots, with powdered charcoal with no masks, for ten hours a day, for 2000 ariary daily— or 56 cents. The pots are mostly exported.\nOf all of the demonstrations we saw, this was the most jarring. There wasn’t much we could think to say, so we thanked and tipped them for their time, and began to walk back to the car.\nJust a dozen feet from the square, you could still feel the heat wafting out as children skipped rope. A few more feet away, a table of polished aluminum trinkets sat on a draped card table. It was hard to combine the scene we had just witnessed and glittering tourist trinkets. Once in the car, Tsu pointed out the expensive Renault in the drive: the smithy’s owner’s car. He told us more about the men’s work, and that the owner did not treat nor pay them well… then he stopped short. He seemed to shrug: the men were good at their jobs, they were able to feed their families, and this was the state of Madagascar.\nWithin a few minutes we were back on the road… much more somber and thoughtful than before."},{"categories":["business","culture","startup","technology"],"link":"https:\u002F\u002Fclintandrewhall.medium.com\u002Fculture-of-business-vs-builders-bfa35857b31b","timestamp":1529437241000,"title":"Culture of Business, or a Culture of Builders?","summary":"Culture of Business, Culture of Builders\nThe following is first of a series, reflecting on my time as a Midwestern engineer working in Silicon Valley. The opinions expressed are my own, and do not directly reflect the official policies or practices of any company or entity. #YMMV\nPhoto courtesy of: pxhere.com\nIt’s been said before: culture is key.\nAs I currently see it, there are two types of company culture: a Culture of Business and a Culture of Builders. Each carry pros and cons, strengths on which to build and weaknesses to overcome, products that fit and products that don’t.\nIn this piece, I’ll give my description of the two.\nWhat is a Culture of Business?\nA Culture of Business is driven by the marketplace.\n\nMembers of thought leadership and sales are the most valued in this culture.\nWhat to build and When it is delivered are priorities — they focus on the customer.\nHow it is built defaults to tried-and-true technologies — they maximize Who is building it and utilize past success.\nDesign and direction are paramount. Driven by the market, those with deep knowledge of the customer push the product forward.\nSchedules, requirements, visuals are detailed and imperative, as they dictate the product, and, thus, any success.\nRisk is sternly calculated, balanced, and avoided if necessary.\n“Chain of command” is rigorously constructed; decisions are often made quickly and confidently by someone one or more levels above.\nWaste is constrained — time and money spent and ROI vs. potential money earned are closely compared and optimized.\nEngineers are seen as resources to allocate, and often as the thinnest bottleneck.\n\nA Culture of Business is considered successful by the products it produces and the money it earns.\nWhat is a Culture of Builders?\nA Culture of Builders is driven by its people and how it builds.\n\nBuilders and those who enable them are most valued in this culture… and anyone producing the product is a Builder.\nHow it is built and Who is building it is prioritized. This does not mean the technology used, (though that is important). It means that all Builders are expected to participate, all are expected to build, all are focused on each phase of iteration.\nWhat to build is loosely defined by a vision, When it is delivered is nebulous and driven by progress.\nBuilders are expected (and trusted) to make decisions to execute the vision. Designers can explore new heuristics, engineers can explore new technologies, managers can push their people in new directions.\nRisk is calculated, but tolerance for risk is very high.\nOrganization structure can be quite flat. Decisions are made by consensus, (perhaps by demonstration).\nWaste doesn’t really exist, perhaps only in cases where communication between Builders was poor and execution was hampered.\nAny Builder can be a bottleneck, and other Builders either work around the constraint or offer ways to avoid it.\nTooling is prioritized — the culture attempts to remove any and all obstacles from the process of building, even at the cost of more investment, (time, money, resources, thought, etc).\n\nA Culture of Builders is considered successful by its innovations and how well it enables its people.\nStrengths\nA Culture of Business is best at identifying a need in the market, designing a solution, and then deploying that solution quickly. They tend to make money just as quickly, focusing on maximizing revenue and delivering a solid minimum viable product, (MVP). Customers are often engaged before the product is built, and financing is found through sales or trial contracts. This makes finding additional resources easier, and development (sometimes) faster.\nA Culture of Builders looks to its people quickly after an idea is formed. Products start as a question or mission and are formed by consensus: stakeholders state their desire, designers formulate a vision, engineers posit feasibility, people and product managers coordinate the effort. This often happens at the same time. Construction is fluid: iteration takes precedence over final product. A failed product is a nebulous term, and once a product is considered a failure, much can be gleaned in technical and design assets.\nWeaknesses\nFor a Culture of Business, stakes are high, and the margin for “failure” is wide. If a Culture of Business champions the wrong vision, if the read of the market is wrong, if the product is not bought… the product dies. The largest ROI of a failed product is what is learned about the market. Built on tried-and-true technologies, it gleans little in terms of tech or design lessons. A Culture of Business can burn out its talent pool with too many failures.\nFor a Culture of Builders, products can be more likely to be considered failures. Patience is required to see a product to its MVP state, which can be longer than expected. In addition, paralysis can be common. With so many people from so many disciplines, the temptation to direct the next iteration is strong. With the wrong culture mindset, this can prevent anything from getting accomplished.\nOpportunities\nA Culture of Business has the pulse of the marketplace, and it can formulate products well in advance. It has the power of prediction, which is invaluable to a company. It also has the ability to analyze its competition quickly, and identify ways to either carve its own niche, or overtake a shortcoming in a competitor’s product.\nA Culture of Builders has the pulse of each Builder’s community, and is poised to both leverage and contribute back to each, internally (between teams) and externally (open source). Tooling that successfully optimizes the process of building can be shared in the industry, facilitating improvements, recruitment, etc. This culture can also pivot quickly, as upfront vision\u002Fdesign\u002Frequirement costs are minimal.\nThreats\nA Culture of Business can be beaten to the market and threaten as much work as has been allocated. Acceleration is slow, but powerful: pivoting to respond to a unforeseen change in the market is a tumultuous process, (akin to trying turning a cruise ship 90° in 60 seconds). A talent pool can be hard to source or maintain in certain sections, as much of the creative process is controlled by a certain sector.\nA Culture of Builders can be beaten by itself. Burning through cash, time or even Builders can cause a product, (or, indeed, an entire company) to implode. Acceleration is quick, but too many pivots and the vision can be lost, resulting in a product that resembles Frankenstein’s Monster instead of a well-oiled system.\nSo… what are they?\nPhoto courtesy of: maxpixel.net\nA Culture of Business is a beehive: a collective of minds driven by singular goals, sharply attuned to the seasons outside, fully prepared with past experience to take advantage of the weather and stockpile golden riches in its walls.\nPhoto courtesy of: publicdomainpictures.net\nA Culture of Builders is like a clock: ticking away into infinity with lots of gears turning, weights lifting, springs unwinding, hands moving… all well-oiled by caretakers and each fully aware of its responsibility to all of the clock’s purposes.\nWhich are you?\nWhich culture describes your workplace? One or the other, or a mix of both? Do you see it favoring one or the other? Is there more to say? Let me know in the comments.\nIn the next of this series, I’ll explore examples of these cultures, where they’ve succeeded, where they’ve failed, and where I see the Midwest and Silicon Valley."},{"categories":["tedx","software-development"],"link":"https:\u002F\u002Fclintandrewhall.medium.com\u002Fneither-sorcerers-nor-alchemists-80b7cd66ce15","timestamp":1406065491000,"title":"Neither Sorcerers nor Alchemists","summary":"Notes from my TEDx Audition: Rethinking the “magic” of software and how it works.\nThe following are my notes from July 21, 2014 for my five-minute audition to speak at TEDxRenfrewCollingwood. It is a person-centric view of earlier writings on the subject that were merely industry-focused.\nIn 1984, my uncle sprayed WD-40 into the disk drive of his brand new computer. He heard a “grinding” noise.\nThirty years later, I sat down to lunch with a friend who told me how she had helped upgrade her father to an iPhone. “And Clint,” she said, “it’s so funny: he actually *apologizes* to Siri, all the time!”\nThat stuck in my head: he apologizes to an app?\nI can’t say I blame him. We’re raised the bar quite high for what a ‘good’ app is, haven’t we? It’s not enough anymore for an app to simply be useful. For an app to succeed it must not only be amazing in capability, it must be intuitive and easy to love… enticing.\nSoftware understanding People has trumped People understanding Software.\nMy uncle recognized the sound of moving parts in the computer and applied his experience to “fix it”. Why would it end up taking so long for my friend’s father to adjust his input and “fix Siri”?\nI believe too much “magic” has been engineered into our technology, and it’s begun impeding people’s ability to be productive or safe.\nI believe that by inspiring and encouraging each other to imagine how systems work, rather than continue to imply that we can’t, those systems can become better and safer.\nMy goal today is to introduce this idea, one that I think can take us much further than engineering can.\nSeveral years ago, I worked for a CEO, Neal Patterson, who liked to gather a group of engineers together and ask them a simple question:\n“Is Software Engineering an Art, or a Science?”\nInvariably the answer would be… both. You solve problems in creative ways with scientific logic.\nBut with Software understanding People, with more and more users being shocked and amazed, the engineering moves from Art or Science… to Sorcery or Alchemy.\nUnfortunately, I believe that’s the reality we live in today. Now, you’re either a muggle, or you’re a wizard. You either “get this stuff”, or you don’t.\nAnd with software magic, you’re not in the audience— you’re the volunteer onstage. And when that amazing feat has the potential to hurt you, you trust the magic (and the magician) to protect you.\nAnd people have been hurt through software: they’ve been “hacked”.\nI had a friend call me, convinced that an ex-boyfriend had paid $20 to “hack” one of her social media accounts.\n“I mean, I know they can do that. You just pay some guy $20 online and he’ll break into your email and then your social media and then you’re hacked.”\nI said, “well, if that were the case… why isn’t Conan O’Brien hacked? Why isn’t Katie Perry, or Kanye West?”\nThe truth is, computers are very smart— but people are clever. With more and more devices and accounts online, the desire to do evil has never been stronger. In fact, today, most “hacking” is done not through a keyboard, but through email or telephone call. It’s through social engineering, not software engineering, that hackers are the most productive.\nWe’re reached a point where fewer and fewer threats can be engineered away.\nSo… what can we do? What if we just “don’t get this stuff?”\nI think we all can… we can get most of it, actually. I think we’ve gotten so used to technology moving so fast around us we just don’t stop to consider how it works.\nIn 1962, Spiderman was introduced as a teenage boy bitten by a massively radioactive spider. The Hulk was irradiated by Gamma rays. In both instances, the lack of the public’s understanding of radiation gave the authors the ability to step into the incredible.\nCan you imagine trying to convince someone today that radiation can endow super powers? Yet we still can use a “faceless hacker” as the arch-enemy of any hero or heroine.\nIt’s only by understanding what is possible that we can begin to recognize what is not possible, too good to be true, or just “not right”.\nWe need to actively reject that software is magic. Instead, we need to ask ourselves the most famous of magical questions: “How did they *do* that?”\nI want to inspire audiences to begin to speculate what’s behind the curtain, to fundamentally reject the idea that technology is beyond understanding. Only then can our expectations (and our input) begin to cooperate with reality. We won’t get frustrated with it. We’ll work with it. And we won’t be fooled easily when someone evil wants to exploit it.\nSo I challenge you: as you take a break and look to your silenced phone for all the Facebook posts you might have missed, take a look at your home screen. Choose your favorite, most mystical, or most enjoyable app. Then ask yourself: how do they do that?\nThen… find out if you’re right."},{"categories":["software","technology"],"link":"https:\u002F\u002Fclintandrewhall.medium.com\u002Fneither-sorcery-nor-alchemy-304691d1fb7c","timestamp":1396235599000,"title":"Neither Sorcery nor Alchemy","summary":"Can we redefine how people perceive technology?\nSo I helped my Mom buy an iPhone last week; she loves it! I’ve been teaching her all kinds of things. Wanna hear something funny, though? She actually apologizes to Siri!\nSo said a friend of mine one afternoon over coffee, giggling over how much fun her mother was having with her new, “magical” device. As she went on, excited about being able to FaceTime with her and send pictures from around Kansas City, I paused.\nShe apologized to an app? Out loud?\nIt shouldn’t be a surprise to induce that kind of reaction from an Apple product: they certainly do a lot of research to make them as approachable as possible. So why would I be surprised that someone would actually apologize to this very life-like entity in their phone for not speaking clearly enough it would understand?\nIt’s not like Apple wouldn’t prefer this reaction. A look at some of their advertising confirms it.\nA screenshot of one of Apple’s early advertisements for the iPad.\nAnd it’s not just users who get this impression. A good number of reviews of Apple’s products, from professionals who follow the industry, use terms like “magic” and “wizard“.\nYet I can’t really call Apple to the carpet here. As a software engineer, I take a great deal of satisfaction from the exclamations of “WHOA! How’d you DO that?” and “I didn’t know that was even POSSIBLE!” Even my mother loves telling people I “make magic with a computer”.\nBut I’m beginning to believe it’s starting to make our work much, much harder.\nWriting Software: Art or Science?\nWhen I worked at Cerner, the CEO, Neal Patterson, would love to ask a roomful of software engineers and architects a simple, but provocative question:\n“Is writing software an art or a science?”\nThe resulting discussion would be lengthy, philosophical and lively. It was always interesting how people would lean one way and then the next… but an hour later everyone would agree: it’s both. Writing software is as much Art as it is Science. The most common praise between code authors involves how fast or well something works… but there’s more to it than that.\nA computer science professor of mine would give ten points for assignments: one point if it worked, two points for the exhaustive test plan, and the remaining seven for what he called “elegance“. I’ve heard code likened to poetry, sonnets of instruction that ebb and flow down the page, much like any spoken language. Anyone who writes it can tell you code can be as beautiful in structure as it is in functionality or performance. Yet unlike literature, it can never just “be”; it is constantly revised, picked over, elevated, shunned, taken as gospel.\nAnd thus, painstakingly and lovingly revised, the software is loaded onto devices all around the world. This is where it gets fun, as it begins to take on a life of its own. Users begin to “play” with it, using it for it’s intended (and, if its good, unintended) purposes. And it is upon these peoples’ reactions that the fate of egos, careers, (and, really, dreams) lie… that’s a lot of pressure.\nSo it comes as no surprise to me that we take advantage of this “magician” status. In this technology age developers are constantly sought out: founders seeking “technical co-founders”, start-ups seeking “hired guns”, recruiters shamelessly flooding LinkedIn with monikers like “ninja”, “jedi”, and “rockstar”.\nThankfully, with some exceptions, developers I know don’t seem to be easily taken by hubris. Most are just in love with their work, solving problems, contributing to amazing communities, creating out of sheer will… basically artists in the medium of computer science. The delight and awe from people is what we love, and the Merlin\u002FYoda perception is just a perk.\nBut indulging in this perk is a mistake.\nA quick dose of perceived reality\nWhen I started working at Facebook, my world was quickly enveloped with the reality of the “Social Graph”. Suddenly I could see just how powerful a click of the “Like” button could be. I wasn’t just telling Facebook I liked an author: I was connecting myself to a branch of a system that could then intelligently connect me elsewhere.\nSure, people have heard the term “Social Graph”. I mean, Facebook launched “Graph Search”, which began answering all kinds of really interesting, (and some believed, creepy) questions about their Facebook.\nI diligently answered all of my friends’ questions about it, but then I began asking a question in return: what does your Social Graph look like?\nSome would try to describe a network of entities as dots and lines… but the most would arrive at something different. The most popular was a two-axis line graph of connections and friends over time. So here we have a computer science data structure, elevated out of code and into the real world. People are building out an incredible network of information…\n…and yet most don’t understand why or how it works.\nBut it goes much further than that. I had a friend reach out to me, convinced that a former boyfriend with lots of money had hired someone to hack her Twitter. She was sure that there were “programs out there” for which you could pay as little as $50 and take over someone’s account. I sent her a link to Twitter’s phishing scam FAQ and told her to email their support team. Her last reply:\nWe know it’s him, we are just trying to figure out how this guy is doing it… I can’t believe Twitter can’t fix it!\nIf you’re at all involved in the software industry, this should be setting off as many alarm bells as it did for me: why would a simple case of phishing be elevated to a hacking conspiracy? More importantly: why is it one where the blame ultimately falls at the feet of the service provider?\nI believe the answer is simple: when someone uses magical functionality, they expect the magic to protect them as well.\nArt becomes Sorcery, Science becomes Alchemy\nWhen someone buys a lawnmower, they understand at a basic level how it works: gas engine, spinning blades, cuts grass. And the manufacturer includes a manual with plenty of warnings and are thus released from any liability of damage or injury… but they might as well leave it out. Your car breaks down on the side of a highway? You pop the hood and take a look inside. Why?\nBecause at the most fundamental of levels, you understand how these things work. You put in gas, that gas burns, exhaust come out the back, and the wheels turn. Television, radio, satellites, GPS… we grasp these concepts at a basic level. No magic there. This carries with cars, microwaves, firearms, checking accounts… these things are fundamentally understood from common experience.\nAt 16, I bought a 1988 Grand Am for $2000. As with any car that age and price, there was an expectation that it would “need a bit of work”. In the end, it turned out to be one of those high school cars to which you simply added oil, rather than change it.\nAmong other things, my father and I had to replace a portion of the engine block. Rather than spend a lot of money on a service shop, we bought a Chilton Repair Manual, a comprehensive book of instructions for the car from bumper to bumper. In the end, I provided its pages with plenty of grease marks and it provided me with plenty of saved cash and experience.\nThe only software that comes with a Chilton manual is Open Source.\nIn the world of technology, we’re driven to make it simple to initiate and then as easy-to-use as possible. Once the user is engaged, the focus shifts to “customer support”: phone banks, online documentation, bug reports and forums. This is the status quo, (and an expensive one, at that).\nIt’s not that our industry is negligent, or lazy. On the contrary, software engineers are diligent, trying to solve a range of user problems as they would any other problem: with software. Indeed, larger and larger proportions of programs are allocated trying to detect problems, missteps, confusion or attack from users. If you click “Send” on an email to your mother about your son’s “attachment to his blue blanket”, Google Mail will warn you your message lacks an attached file.\nSoftware understanding its users has trumped\nusers understanding their software.\nAnd because of this, software becomes sorcery. Harry Potter becomes real life: consumers are muggles, reliant on the wizards who conjured these amazements to keep our world working, (and safe). Only those who have raw talent, nurtured that talent, trained, dedicated their lives to these magical constructs know for certain how they work.\nHow many movies or television shows have used nebulous software concepts as either hero or villain in their plot? In some like-our world, an evil geek in glasses unleashes some 3D hydra virus upon a banking network, stealing billions. Elsewhere, like the Deus ex Machina of ancient Greece, fast hands over a keyboard in the FBI office by some geek in glasses overcomes evil.\nHonestly, it doesn’t take much to suspend disbelief. Take this clip from a popular television show, depicting a world where two people can type on one keyboard, and unplugging a single terminal stops a network “hack”?\nhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fmedia\u002Fde6d74249afe06bf5f7630f0f702b572\u002Fhref\nI believe educating people on the fly, only as necessary, has led to distrust, more expensive support, and diminished demand. Further, it has caused a reluctance to be open, both from people to try new services and from services who don’t want to harm the trust they’ve built thus far. I think it’s time we bring the software systems we use, including their development, support, capabilities and limitations, beyond their meager support systems and into greater public (and social) awareness.\nThe New Perk\nImagine if people had an opportunity to understood software better at a fundamental level?\nThat Siri isn’t some magic assistant in a phone, but is really a Internet-powered vocal-recognition engine with a well-seeded database of responses?\nThat a cable modem gives a unique “phone number address” that is public, so it’s safer to have an internal set of numbers with Caller ID?\nThat “the blue E” is not “the Internet”, and there are other windows through which to view the actual Internet?\nWouldn’t this lead to the contracting of this “infinite possibility” and thus, “potential evil” of the software world? That granting a video service access to your graph means not having to watch an advertisement for a steakhouse when you’re a vegetarian? That the word “privacy” is no longer as black and white as what’s written in your diary vs written on a billboard?\nWouldn’t understanding software lead to people being better equipped to recognize problems? That a site promising free music wants to install something you don’t recognize? That a Nigerian prince sitting on vast wealth plucked an email address out of thin air? That the person trolling your blog didn’t drop fifty bucks on some program to hack your Twitter account?\nTwo things happen: support infrastructure is relieved of stress, and savvy users are better equipped to tell you what they want.\nSure, we may lose a bit of our magical personas. But I think it’s a small price to pay.\nHow do we do it?\n“Never oppose if you can’t propose.” It’s a great mantra for software development, and it’s one I’ll hold here. I’m supporting four solutions that could lead us to a better ecosystem.\nMore Open-source Initiatives\nFor end-users, more open-source software means greater transparency and more understanding. Knowing that your favorite iPhone app isn’t hundreds of thousands of lines of code that doesn’t transfer your contact list or bank information to the developer should be a fact easily believed. Public, readable code can help.\nEven though consumers don’t care to know how their favorite sausage is made, they have a very good idea already. This should be the case with software.\nPivot Marketing\nProduct marketing still serves as the biggest instigator of a product relationship. Not only should they and their materials be well-versed in what the product is (and isn’t), both should resist the temptation to cast their products as “mystical”. Leaving the details to the user manual, (which, let’s face it, most people ignore until they have a problem), will only lead to frustration.\nUsers should be more delighted and amazed by how well it works and less by that it works.\nCreating a Resource for Popular Culture\nSources of entertainment can be more effective in education than any textbook or manual. Case in point: some tourists ask to see more info on Jack when they visit the Titanic museum.\nTherefore, I believe providing writers with a credible source of information and “tech fact checking” could be a useful tool. It could help to keep plots involving software and technology more “in the clouds” of the possible, rather than in the stratosphere of the incredible.\nI want to launch a new .org website to curate and collect “tech facts and stories” for the entertainment industry.\nCreating Popular Culture\nMy last suggestion is perhaps the most ambitious of all… but as a software engineer with a background in theatre, I had to list it.\nI’d like to pitch a television series in which the first 15 minutes is used to describe a common technology and how it works. This could include little-known facts, detailed descriptions and how to use it properly and safely. The remaining 45 minutes would be a guest-written and directed comedy or drama in which the tech is prominently featured.\nBy making technology the focus instead of the foil in a popular culture context, people might gain better understanding of how it works and fits in their lives.\nThese are the first four ideas I’ve had. I’m still working to create more, and other posts on this topic. In the meantime, I welcome your thoughts!"}]}};</script><script src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-L175P3SMWY" async></script><script>function

I work to make the web beautiful, both on its surface and beneath.</p><p>I'm a demonstrated expert in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, React/Flux/Relay, and more. I specialize in techniques promoting web agnostics, semantics, and accessibility. I'm comfortable with varying levels of skill in any web full stack, having written and maintained production code in JS, PHP, Java and Ruby-on-Rails. I currently prefer React+Node or React Native for most of my personal projects.</p><p>I'm a regular consumer and occasional contributor to open source projects and client APIs. If I have a suggestion for a website or application, I prefer to demonstrate the idea using an API rather than just describe it-- Code Wins Arguments.</p><p>I look for opportunities where I can make strong, direct and meaningful contributions to a team, to users and to the web. I'm comfortable functioning as both designer and engineer, advising on both the technical and aesthetic. I'm affable and good-natured, yet results-driven and competitive.
