# About this repository

This is a static build of [clintandrewhall.com](https://github.com/clintandrewhall/clintandrewhall.com).  It is generated automatically by a Github Action and committed to this repo by [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages).

For the curious, I used to CD my website with Heroku.  Since Heroku had their breach and has [disabled GH OAuth tokens](https://status.heroku.com/incidents/2413), I decided to pull the trigger on an auto-deploy-to-gh-pages approach.

It was [pretty easy](https://github.com/clintandrewhall/clintandrewhall.com/commit/22176bf5f4e693cc942cad21bdafba5d7807722b), in [the end](https://github.com/clintandrewhall/clintandrewhall.com/commits/main).
